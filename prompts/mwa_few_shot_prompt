### Example 1
    #### Brand Recognition Analysis:
    - The page claims to be from "Amazon," but the logo is pixelated and differs from Amazon's official branding.
    - The URL ("amaz0n-deals.com") contains a typo in the brand name.
    - No HTTPS protocol, which is uncharacteristic of Amazon.

    #### Diction and Syntax Analysis:
    HTML Content:
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>CONGRATULATIONS!</h1>
        <p>You have been SELECTED for an exclusive reward. Claim NOW by clicking <a href='phishing-link'>here</a>.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    - **Analysis**:
      1. **Excessive Capitalization**: "CONGRATULATIONS!" and "SELECTED" use unnecessary capitalization to draw attention.
      2. **Urgent Tone**: Words like "NOW" and "exclusive reward" create a false sense of urgency.
      3. **Suspicious Hyperlink**: The anchor tag's `href` points to an ambiguous "phishing-link," which isn't related to Amazon.

    #### Screenshot Analysis:
    - The screenshot shows a generic page layout with no Amazon branding or typical design elements.
    - The "Claim Now" button is styled in bright red, inconsistent with Amazon's usual colors.

    #### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    1. The brand logo is inconsistent and poorly designed.
    2. HTML content includes urgent and overly excited diction with capitalization.
    3. The visual design lacks Amazon's distinctive elements, making the page highly suspicious.

    #### Classification: High Phishing Risk

    ### Example 2
    #### Brand Recognition Analysis:
    - The page claims to be from "PayPal" but lacks the PayPal logo.
    - The URL ("p@y-pal-secure.com") uses obfuscated characters to mimic the brand.

    #### Diction and Syntax Analysis:
    HTML Content:
    <html>
      <body>
        <h2>Important Notice</h2>
        <p>Your account has been locked due to suspicious activity. Please <a href='verify-login'>log in</a> to resolve this.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
    - **Analysis**:
      1. **Polite but Generic Language**: The message lacks personal details like the user's name.
      2. **Vague Threat**: "Suspicious activity" isn't specified, leaving ambiguity.
      3. **Suspicious Link**: The `verify-login` URL isn't a recognized PayPal domain.

    #### Screenshot Analysis:
    - The screenshot shows a warning icon with "PayPal Secure" in a large font.
    - The page is missing PayPal's standard navigation bar and footer.

    #### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
    1. The URL uses obfuscation to mimic PayPal, which is a strong phishing indicator.
    2. HTML includes vague threats and lacks personalization, reducing legitimacy.
    3. The visual design is inconsistent with PayPalâ€™s authentic website.
