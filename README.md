# Adaptive-Linguistic-Prompting-ALP-Multimodal-LLM-Phishing-Detection
## Data Source

This project uses a curated dataset originally created by [Jehyun Lee et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05941) as part of their work on multimodal LLM-based phishing detection.

- The original dataset is available at: [Multimodal_LLM_Phishing_Detection (GitHub)](https://github.com/JehLeeKR/Multimodal_LLM_Phishing_Detection)
- We apply a filtered version of this dataset (311 benign, 289 phishing samples), as described in Section 3.2 of our paper (Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) Enhances Phishing Webpage Detection in Multimodal Large Language Models).
- All credit for the dataset content and original data collection goes to the original authors.

# Ethical Statement: 
This work is done for research purposes and for the general advancement of the use of LLMs in the space of cybersecurity and phishing detection. The few-shot prompts and the original dataset should NOT be used for any unethical or illegal purposes.
